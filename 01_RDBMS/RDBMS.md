## Tiers architectures

2-tier architecture:
- Client
- Server (Database)
- Client connects directly to the database

3-tier architecture:
- Client
- Application server
- Database

n-tier architecture:
- Client
- Web servers
- Application server
- Database


## Application Types

- Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)
	- Order entry, ATM, online banking
- Decision Support Systems (DSS)
	- Probably OLAP
	- High number of rows for read operations mostly or load bulk of rows
	- BI and reporting tools
- General purposes


Oracle Database and NoSQL Databases
- Oracle Database is not a NoSQL Database
- There is a NoSQL database by Oracle called **Oracle NoSQL Database**
